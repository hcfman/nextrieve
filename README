		    NexTrieve Full Text Search Engine

WHAT IS IT?

NexTrieve is a full-text search engine.  It supports exact-word
searching and fuzzy searching.  It supports the association of string,
numeric and boolean attributes with indexed documents.

The core applications (ntvindex, ntvquerygen, ntvsearch) accept and
produce XML formatted streams.  Supplied scripts allow the creation of
indexes that can be searched with a browser (using the CGI application
ntvultralite) that index mail archives, HTML, DOC and PDF files.

INSTALLATION

Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.  The system has
currently been installed on Linux systems.

DOCUMENTATION

Full HTML documentation can be found under docs/html.

A FEW BASIC POINTERS

The raw nextrieve commands are:
    ntvindex
	Accepts XML from various filters either on stdin or from a file
	and indexes the text and attributes.
    ntvsearch
	Accepts a search query specified in XML form on stdin (normally 
	generated by ntvquerygen), and produces search results in XML form.
    ntvsearchd
	A daemon version of ntvsearch, normally multi-threaded.
    ntvultralite
	Normally invoked as part of a CGI script; performs a search in a
	web based environment, returning results normally in HTML form
	as defined by various template files.
    ntvcached
	A 'caching server' that appears like an ntvsearchd to a user but
	that can actually be using one or more ntvsearchd processes to
	operate.  Used in high throughput and high reliability situations.

Normally indexes intended be usable in an HTTP environment are created
with the script
    ntvmakenewwebindex
from which a variety of HTML template options can be chosen.
