.IX Title "NTVULTRALITE 1"
.TH NTVULTRALITE 1 "2.0.0" "2002-11-22" "NexTrieve"
.UC
.SH "NAME"
ntvultralite \- NexTrieve \s-1HTML\s0 template filling process
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
NTVBASE=basedir NTVNAME=scriptname ntvultralite
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBntvultralite\fR is basically a template-filling process used as part
of a web server.
It is invoked
in response to the web server receiving a \s-1POST\s0 or \s-1GET\s0 message from a browser.
\&\fBntvultralite\fR analyzes the message data received and constructs a query
to be applied to a text index.
This query can be processed directly by ntvultralite (which is possible if the
text index is reasonably small and is directly accessable),
or it can be sent to a nextrieve search server on the same or a different
machine.
.PP
The resulting \s-1XML\s0 hitlist is then analyzed and merged with appropriate
\&\s-1HTML\s0 templates to produce the final resultant \s-1HTML\s0.
.PP
\&\fBntvultralite\fR is normally executed as part of a \s-1CGI\s0 script \*(-- this script
has all the information in its environment relating to the \s-1POST\s0 or \s-1GET\s0
request issued by the remote web user.  There is normally a small program
under cgi-bin \*(-- created automatically if the text index was installed
with ntvmakenewwebindex \*(-- that sets two other
environment variables necessary for \fBntvultralite\fR to work, namely:
.Ip "\s-1NTVBASE\s0" 4
.IX Item "NTVBASE"
A base directory.
.Ip "\s-1NTVNAME\s0" 4
.IX Item "NTVNAME"
A simple name discriminating between various different indexes that can be
searched by ultralite processes or even different forms for the same
index.
.PP
These two pieces of information, \fB$NTVBASE\fR and \fB$NTVNAME\fR, are
used by \fBntvultralite\fR to locate all the other information it needs.
.PP
The resource file defining the text index information is assumed
to be at
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $NTVBASE/$NTVNAME/$NTVNAME.res
.Ve
All templates are assumed to be under a directory
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $NTVBASE/$NTVNAME/templates/
.Ve
with names starting with two state-characters (described later) and terminating
with \fB$NTVNAME\fR.
.Sh "Ntvultralite-Specific Resource Information"
.IX Subsection "Ntvultralite-Specific Resource Information"
There are a number of elements present in the resource file of the text
index that are specific to ntvultralite, found in <ultralite>
elements.  The format of this and other elements found in the
resource file is described in \fIntvresourcefile\fR\|(5).
.PP
A given \fBntvultralite\fR process will preferentially use an <ultralite>
container in the resource file that is tagged with 'name="\fI$NTVNAME\fR"'.
If no such container exists,
\&\fBntvultralite\fR will attempt to use a \*(L"default\*(R" <ultralite>
container defined as having no name attribute.
.Sh "Constructing the Search Query"
.IX Subsection "Constructing the Search Query"
The incoming information from a form that's submitting a query
is a sequence of names and values, like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    namea=vala&nameb=valb&namec=valc...
.Ve
These names are names attached to various fields in the submitting form;
the values are the values either typed in by the user, or selected
by the user.
.PP
There are a set of names that are \*(L"special\*(R" to \fBntvultralite\fR, and that
will cause it to perform special actions.  This set is:
.Ip "\fBq=querytext\fR" 4
.IX Item "q=querytext"
General query text.  Words may be prefixed with '+' or '\-'; '+' indicating
the word must be present in returned documents, '\-' indicating it cannot
be present in returned documents.
.Ip "\fBqany=query-any-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "qany=query-any-text"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fBqall=query-all-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "qall=query-all-text"
.Ip "\fBqnot=query-not-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "qnot=query-not-text"
.PD
Special query text.
Words present in
query-all-text must be present in documents returned by an exact search.
Words present in query-not-text are not allowed to be present in documents
returned by an exact search.  Words in query-any-text may or may not
be present in returned documents for an exact search.
.Sp
These are equivalent to the the <qany>, <qall> and <qnot> elements
present in an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBi=offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "i=offset"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fBdh=offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "dh=offset"
.Ip "\fBth=offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "th=offset"
.PD
The offset (1\-based), number of hits to display,
and number of hits to process for the query.
These are equivalent to the firsthit, displayedhits and totalhits
attributes of an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBh=highlighting\fR" 4
.IX Item "h=highlighting"
The minimum number of characters in a word present in the preview before
it is allowed to be hightlighted.  This is equivalent to a
highlightlength attribute of an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBf=fuzzylevel\fR" 4
.IX Item "f=fuzzylevel"
The fuzzylevel to use for a fuzzy search.
This is equivalent to the fuzzylevel attribute of an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBcs=constraint\fR" 4
.IX Item "cs=constraint"
A constraint expression to use.
This is equivalent to a <constraint> element in an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBdb=idxname\fR" 4
.IX Item "db=idxname"
A logical text index name to use.
This is equivalent to an <indexname> element in an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBfuzzy=0|1\fR" 4
.IX Item "fuzzy=0|1"
Perform a fuzzy search if the value is non-zero, otherwise an exact search.
Equivalent to type=\*(L"exact\*(R" or type=\*(L"fuzzy\*(R" in an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBexact=0|1\fR" 4
.IX Item "exact=0|1"
Perform an exact search if the value is non-zero, otherwise a fuzzy search.
Equivalent to type=\*(L"fuzzy\*(R" or type=\*(L"exact\*(R" in an \s-1XML\s0 query.
.Ip "\fBntvselect=attrname\fR" 4
.IX Item "ntvselect=attrname"
If \fIattrname\fR refers to a flag-type attribute defined in the text
index, any search will be performed only on documents having this
attribute set.
.Ip "\fBvblname=value\fR" 4
.IX Item "vblname=value"
Any name starting with \*(L"vbl\*(R" will be processed specially.  See the
section \*(L"Variables\*(R" below.
.Ip "\fBattrname\fR" 4
.IX Item "attrname"
If \fIattrname\fR refers to a flag-type attribute defined in the text
index, any search will be performed only on documents having this
attribute set.
If multiple attributes are defined in this way (implying multiple checkboxes
have been checked by the user), an \*(L"or\*(R" operation is performed.  Ie,
any search will be on a set of documents having at least one of the nominated
attributes set.
More flexible control is allowed via the use of \*(L"vbl\*(R" type form variables.
.PP
This information is used to construct a query.
.Sh "Variables"
.IX Subsection "Variables"
The use of \*(L"variables\*(R", input fields whose name starts with \*(L"vbl\*(R",
allows a reasonably flexible way of constructing search text and constraints
with more complex search forms.
There are several elements in the resource file that are specific
to variables in ntvultralite.  These elements are:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <vblsub name="vblname" text="text"/>
\&    <vblrange name1="vblname1" name2="vblname2"/>
\&    <vbluse name="vblname" type="constraint"|"text"|"texttype"
\&            class="any"|"all"|"not"|"free"|"<ntv-vblname2>"/> TABLEEND
.Ve
The intent is to provide the following functionality:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Map a field value directly to part of a constraint expression.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Allow simple range operations, where up to two input fields contribute
to the constraint expression fragment.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Allow a single query-text field to have its function changed
from \*(L"any\*(R" words to \*(L"all\*(R" words by use of another checkbox or radio
control field.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Allow similar functionality to the above for constraint expression
fragments (eg, \*(L"all\*(R" keywords, or \*(L"some\*(R" keywords).
.PP
There are a number of simple steps to providing the above solutions.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Map a given input field and value to a constraint expression fragment.
Eg, if input field \*(L"vblstart\*(R" has value 20010130, we might want to get
a constraint expression fragment of \*(L"startdate >= 20010130\*(R" being
generated.  This is possible through the use of \fBvblsub\fR elements
in the resource file.  Eg,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <vblsub name="vblstart"
\&            text="startdate &gt;= &lt;ntv-value&gt;"/> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Allow constraint expression fragments to be built from the presence of
values in two fields, indicating a range operation rather than a single
comparison.  Eg, if there are two fields \*(L"vblstart\*(R" and \*(L"vblend\*(R", one or the
other or both may have values posted from the form.
.Sp
If only \*(L"vblstart\*(R" has a value of \*(L"20010130\*(R", we might want to map it to the
constraint
expression fragment \*(L"startdate >= 20010130\*(R" as above.
.Sp
If only \*(L"vblend\*(R"
has a value of \*(L"20010330\*(R", we might want to map it to the constraint
expression fragment \*(L"enddate <= 20010330\*(R".
.Sp
If both are present, however, we would want the constraint expression
fragment to be \*(L"(startdate >= 20010130 & enddate <= 20010330)\*(R" (note
the enclosing parentheses and automatic internal \*(L"and\*(R" operation).
.Sp
This is possible through use of the \fBvblrange\fR elements in the
resource file.  Eg,
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <vblrange name1="vblstart" name2="vblend"/> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Indicate whether a given field and value are part of \*(L"any-inclusion\*(R",
\&\*(L"all-inclusion\*(R" or \*(L"exclusion\*(R" operations, and whether it is a
a constraint-expression fragment or a query-text fragment.
This is possible by use of
\&\fBvbluse\fR elements in the resource file.  Eg,
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <vbluse name="vblstart" type="constraint" class="any"/> TABLEEND
.Ve
.PP
The order of operations that ntvultralite performs during variable
processing is as follows.
.Ip "Basic Substitution" 4
.IX Item "Basic Substitution"
Any variable with a \fInon-empty\fR value is mapped through any \fBvblsub\fR
element that has a matching name.
The presence of <ntv-value> in the text of the <vblsub> element
is replaced with the actual variable value.
After the substitution, the variable has its value changed to be the
result of the substitution.
.Sp
Eg, having a line in the resource file of the form:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <vblsub name="vblstartdate" text="startdate &gt;= &lt;ntv-value&gt;"/> TABLEEND
.Ve
will change a \*(L"vblstartdate\*(R" value of \*(L"20010130\*(R" to \*(L"startdate >= 20010130\*(R".
.Ip "Basic Ranges" 4
.IX Item "Basic Ranges"
After substituting all variables, ranging takes place.  If a \fBvblrange\fR
element finds that both its variables have non-empty values, it will
change the value of the first variable to reflect the complete range
expression, and remove the value of the second variable to prevent
further use of it.
.Sp
Eg if, after substitution, we have the following variables and values:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    TABLESTART
\&    vblstartdate    startdate >= 20010130
\&    vblenddate      enddate <= 20010330 TABLEEND
.Ve
After processing the element:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <vblsub name="vblstartdate" name2="vblenddate"/> TABLEEND
.Ve
The variable \*(L"vblstartdate\*(R" will have a value of
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    "(startdate >= 20010130 & enddate <= 20010330)" TABLEEND
.Ve
and the variable \*(L"vblenddate\*(R" will be empty.
.Ip "Final Use" 4
.IX Item "Final Use"
Finally the text and constraint fragments are combined.
.Sp
This is performed through the use of \fBvbluse\fR elements.  Each element
specifies a variable name, its use (constraint, text or texttype)
and its inclusion or exclusion.  This final piece of data
(inclusion or exclusion) can be provided by another variable
if <ntv-vbl vblname> is used.
.Sp
Inclusion should indicate one of \*(L"any\*(R", \*(L"all\*(R", \*(L"not\*(R" or \*(L"free\*(R".
.Sp
With a text variable, this simply indicates that the text becomes part of the
qany, qall, qnot or q strings, representing the query text.
.Sp
With a constraint variable, there are equivalent (internal) parts of the
constraint expression being built up.  If \*(L"any\*(R" is specified, the \*(L"any\*(R"
part of the constraint will be augmented with \*(L"|\*(R" (or) and the expression
fragment.  If \*(L"all\*(R" is specified, the \*(L"all\*(R" part of the constraint is
augmented with \*(L"&\*(R" (and) and the expression fragment.  If \*(L"not\*(R" is specified
the \*(L"not\*(R" part of the constraint (which is later completely
negated) will be augmented with \*(L"&\*(R" (and) and the
expression fragment.
.Sp
After all this, the final constraint expression is built by combining
the classified (any, all, not) parts of the constraint, using parentheses
and \*(L"|\*(R" (or) operators where appropriate.
.Sp
With a texttype variable, the text simply defines a space-separated
sequence of texttypes should should be searched.  Inclusion operators
are simply ignored.
.Sh "Choosing Templates"
.IX Subsection "Choosing Templates"
In order to view results or present a search form we need to define
what the page looks like.
This is done using \*(L"templates\*(R".  A template is a normal \s-1HTML\s0
page with the addition of some extra tags specific to ntvultralite.
These special tags are recognised by \fBntvultralite\fR, and filled in
with automatically generated \s-1HTML\s0 fragments appropriate to the information
wanted to be displayed.
.PP
All templates are assumed to be under a directory
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $NTVBASE/$NTVNAME/templates/
.Ve
There is a naming convention associated with template files.
Ntvultralite will automatically construct a template name starting
with two letters
and ending with the name of the script being run (the name of the script
being defined by the environment variable \fB$NTVNAME\fR, set up
by the cgi program invoking \fBntvultralite\fR).
.PP
The first letter is one of:
.Ip "_" 4
.IX Item "_"
No query has been done.  Ie, this is the initial page.
.Ip "Q" 4
.IX Item "Q"
A query was performed and returned results, which are
being displayed.
.Ip "E" 4
.IX Item "E"
A query was performed, but there were no results.
.PP
The second letter is defined by whether or not we're in \*(L"advanced\*(R" mode
or not.  In advanced mode a more complicated input page can be used
with more controls over the search being performed.
The second template name letter is one of:
.Ip "_" 4
.IX Item "_"
We're in \*(L"simple\*(R" mode.
.Ip "A" 4
.IX Item "A"
We're in \*(L"advanced\*(R" mode.
.PP
It is possible to switch to different sets of template files in two
different ways described below.  Both methods define a new subdirectory that
should be present under \f(CW$NTVBASE\fR/$NTVNAME/templates and which should contain
all the conventionally named template files required.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
When a flag-type attribute is set for a search, nominally to search
a particular portion of the text index.
.Sp
The valid attributes to cause switching are specified in the resource file
with \fBattributetemplate\fR elements.  The first such element that has an
attribute set on the form is used.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
When a particular keyword is present in the search string.
.Sp
The valid keywords are specified using \fBswitchedtemplate\fR
elements in the resource file.
.Sp
Note that it is not possible to have both \fBswitchedtemplate\fR
elements and \fBattributetemplate\fR elements in the same resource file.
.Sh "Filling Templates"
.IX Subsection "Filling Templates"
Various \fBntvultralite\fR specific tags are recognised in the \s-1HTML\s0 templates
and are replaced by \fBntvultralite\fR.  These tags are listed here.
.Ip "<\fBntv-attrmap\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-attrmap>"
Used inside <ntv-loop>...</ntv-loop>.
Replaced with the content specified in the resource file (using
\&\fBattrmap\fR elements) of the first flag-attribute that's set for the hit.
.Ip "<\fBntv-checkbox*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-checkbox*>"
Replaced by a form checkbox widget for use in restricting the search to
documents having a specified flag-type attribute set.
It takes the attribute name as a parameter as in:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-checkbox support> TABLEEND
.Ve
This allows simple use of flag-type attributes as a constraint, without
having to use the more powerful (although more complex) general constraint
construction using ntvultralite form variables starting with \*(L"vbl\*(R".
.Sp
There are limitations.  If multiple checkboxes are used on a form to
control multiple attributes, the checked attributes are \*(L"or-ed\*(R" together;
there is no \*(L"and\*(R" option.
.Sp
If no attributes are checked, a search of the entire text
index is performed.
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-constraint*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-constraint*>"
Replaced by a form widget that accepts user input in a text box.
Any extra material found is placed in the resulting \s-1INPUT\s0 widget,
such as \*(L"SIZE=value\*(R", or an initialization using <ntv-printconstraint>.
Eg:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-constraint VALUE="<ntv-printconstraint>"> TABLEEND
.Ve
The data entered by the user is returned as a \*(L"cs\*(R" form variable defining
a constraint to be applied.
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-displayedhits\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-displayedhits>"
Replaced by a form widget that accepts user input in a text box.
The text box is automatically initialized with the current value of
displayedhits.  The data entered by the user is returned as a form variable
\&\*(L"d\*(R", defining the number of hits to display for the search.
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-exactbutton\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-exactbutton>"
Replaced with a form checkbox widget.  When \*(L"checked\*(R" a form variable called
\&\*(L"exact\*(R" will be returned indicating an exact search is to be performed.
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-fuzzybutton\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-fuzzybutton>"
Replaced with a form checkbox widget.  When \*(L"checked\*(R" a form variable called
\&\*(L"fuzzy\*(R" will be returned indicating a fuzzy search is to be performed.
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-fuzzyfactor\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-fuzzyfactor>"
For use in an advanced-search page.
Replaced with a form select widget with allowable values of 1, 2 and 3

as the form variable \*(L"f\*(R".
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-highlight\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-highlight>"
For use in an advanced-search page.
Replaced with a form select widget with allowable values of 1 through 10
that define the minimum number of characters a preview word must have
before it is highlighted.

Data entered by the user is returned as the \*(L"h\*(R" form variable.
.Ip "<\fBntv-ctl-moderadio-fuzzy*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-ctl-moderadio-fuzzy*>"
Replaced with a form radio-button widget.  It should be used once with
a parameter of \*(L"1\*(R" for allowing a fuzzy search when checked, and once with
a parameter of \*(L"0\*(R" for allowing an exact search when checked.
.Sp
The user selection is returned as the value for the \*(L"fuzzy\*(R" form variable.

The value entered by the user is returned attached to the \*(L"th\*(R" form variable.
.Ip "<\fBntv-defcheckbox*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-defcheckbox*>"
The parameter defines the name of a flag-attribute \*(-- any later
<ntv-checkbox> tag referring to the same attribute will be defaulted
to a \*(L"checked\*(R" state.
.Ip "<\fBntv-exec*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-exec*>"
If an <\fBexecallow value=\*(L"1\*(R"\fR> element is present in the resource file for
the text index, \fBntvultralite\fR permits the use of  <ntv-exec*>
tags.  The parameter of such a tag should refer to a program and parameters
that can be run via the use of \*(L"\fIpopen()\fR\*(R".  The <ntv-exec*>

.IX Item "<ntv-hit-linkattr*>"
Used inside <ntv-loop></ntv-loop>.
Parameters can be given that are treated as a sequence of attribute names.
The first name encountered that has a non-empty value in the current hit
defines the textual value substituted.  If the last parameter starts with
single or double
quotes it will be used as the value if no non-empty attributes have been found.
The value substituted will be encoded in a manner suitable for using as
a link.
.Sp
See <ntv-loop> for an example usage.
.Ip "<\fBntv-hit-percent\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-hit-percent>"

.IX Item "<ntv-hits-total>"
Used after <ntv-loophead>.
Replaced by the total number of hits in the current hit list.
.Ip "<\fBntv-include*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-include*>"
The parameter is treated as a filename, whose contents are substituted
at this point by \fBntvultralite\fR.
.Ip "<\fBntv-linkconstraint\fR>" 4

.Ip "<\fBntv-loop\fR>*<\fB/ntv-loop\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-loop>*</ntv-loop>"
These two tags define a region of \s-1HTML\s0 that is repeated and substituted
once for each hit being displayed in a result list.
.Sp
An example of its use is:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&    TABLESTART

\&        </TD>
\&    </TR>
\&    </TABLE>
\&    </ntv-loop> TABLEEND
.Ve
For each hit we print the hit number (using <ntv-hit-count>),
a link defined by the \*(L"filename\*(R" attribute of the hit (using
<ntv-hit-linkattr filename>)
and a title defined by the \*(L"title\*(R" attribute
(using <ntv-hit-printattr title filename \*(L"no title available\*(R">).
This is followed on the next line by the preview text.
.Sp
Note that hits with a \*(L"priority\*(R" attribute of 2 are backgrounded in red
using the <ntv-hit-ifattreq priority 2>BGCOLOR=\*(L"#FF0000\*(R"</ntv-hit-if> construct.
.Sp
Also note the use of <ntv-hit-printattr> which will use a title
attribute if one exists, otherwise the filename attribute, otherwise it will
use the text \*(L"no title available\*(R" as the title.
.Ip "<\fBntv-loophead\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-loophead>"
Marks a point in the \s-1HTML\s0 at which we can use result-oriented \fBntvultralite\fR
tags.
.Ip "<\fBntv-pages\fR*<\fB/ntv-pages\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-pages*</ntv-pages>"
Used to define a sequence of page buttons where the hit list extends
over multiple pages.
A numeric parameter is given which is taken to be the maximum number of
buttons wanted.
The \s-1HTML\s0 area between these two tags is repeated and substituted once for
each page button generated.  During this substitution the <ntv-pg-number>
and <ntv-pg-link> tags can be used giving information about the
page number represented by the button, and a link to display that page
of results.
.Sp
A complete example of how to use the various <ntv-pg> tags is:
.Sp
.Vb 21
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-pg-ifmlt>
\&    Pages: <FONT FACE="arial" SIZE=-1>
\&    <ntv-pg-ifprv>

.Ve
Note that the code above can be treated as \*(L"boilerplate\*(R" \*(-- ie, taken
and modified to perform what is wanted, rather than being created from
scratch.
.Sp
If there are multiple pages (<ntv-pg-ifmlt>...</ntv-pg-ifmlt>),
buttons will be displayed.
.Sp
If there is a previous page (<ntv-pg-ifprv>...</ntv-pg-ifprv>),
a link to the first page will be created (<ntv-pg-linkfirst>), and
a link to the previous page will be created (<ntv-pg-linkprv>).
.Sp
This is followed by up to 10 page buttons (<ntv-pages 10>...</ntv-pages>),
one of which will be the current
page (<ntv-pg-ifcur>...</ntv-pg-ifcur>)
which has its number-text highlighted.
.Sp
If there is a next page (<ntv-pg-ifnxt>...</ntv-pg-ifnxt>),
links to the next page and last page are provided.
.Ip "<\fBntv-pg-ifcur\fR>*<\fB/ntv-pg-ifcur\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-pg-ifcur>*</ntv-pg-ifcur>"
Used within <ntv-pages*</ntv-pages>.
The \s-1HTML\s0 area between these two tags is substituted if the current page
button represents the \*(L"current\*(R" page.  Otherwise the area is simply removed.

.Ip "<\fBntv-pg-ifnxt\fR>*<\fB/ntv-pg-ifnxt\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-pg-ifnxt>*</ntv-pg-ifnxt>"
The \s-1HTML\s0 area between these two tags is substituted if there is a page

Otherwise the area is simply removed.
.Ip "<\fBntv-pg-ifprv\fR>*<\fB/ntv-pg-ifprv\fR>" 4

.IX Item "<ntv-pg-link>"
Used within <ntv-pages*</ntv-pages>.

Replaced by the number of the next page of results.
.Ip "<\fBntv-pg-prv\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-pg-prv>"
Replaced by the number of the previous page of results.
.Ip "<\fBntv-printconstraint\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-printconstraint>"
Like <ntv-hit-linkconstraint*> except that the information is encoded
for general display rather than for use as a link.
.Ip "<\fBntv-script\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-script>"
Replaced by the \s-1URL\s0 of the \s-1CGI\s0 program.  Eg:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <FORM ACTION="<ntv-script>" METHOD=POST> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "<\fBntv-search\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-search>"
Replaced by the text of the current query.  This represents the entire
search query.  Words prefixed with '+' are required to be in returned
documents.  Words prefixed with '\-' are required to \s-1NOT\s0 be in returned
documents.
.Sp
Use either <ntv-search> or some of the set of inputs
<ntv-searchall>, <ntv-searchany>, <ntv-searchnot>
on any particular search page.  Don't use all of them on a single page.
.Sp
This can be used to initialize an ntv-ctl-search control, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-ctl-search VALUE="<ntv-search>"> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "\fB<ntv-searchall\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-searchall>"
Replaced by the text of the \*(L"all\*(R" part of the current query, ie, those
words in the general query prefixed with '+', with the '+' removed.
.Sp
This can be used to initialize a ntv-ctl-searchall control, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-ctl-searchall VALUE="<ntv-searchall>"> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "<\fBntv-searchany\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-searchany>"
Replaced by the text of the \*(L"any\*(R" part of the current query.

This can be used to initialize a ntv-ctl-searchany control, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-ctl-searchany VALUE="<ntv-searchany>"> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "<\fBntv-searchnot\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-searchnot>"
Replaced by the text of the \*(L"not\*(R" part of the current query, ie, those
words in the general query prefixed with '\-', with the '\-' removed.
.Sp
This can be used to initialize a ntv-ctl-searchnot control, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    TABLESTART
\&    <ntv-ctl-searchnot VALUE="<ntv-searchnot>"> TABLEEND
.Ve
.Ip "<\fBntv-select*\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-select*>"
Can be used instead of the <ntv-checkbox> tag for simple control
of flag-type attributes in a search.
A sequence of attribute names is expected as a parameter to <ntv-select>.
Each of these names should refer to a flag-type attribute defined in the
text index.
.Sp
A form select widget is constructed having a \*(L"display name\*(R" constructed
from a matching <selectname> element in the resource file for the
text index.  It is this \*(L"display name\*(R" that the user sees in his
selection.
.Sp
This is simpler than the use of \*(L"vbl\*(R" type form variables although it
is less powerful.
<ntv-checkbox> tags should not be used if <ntv-select*> is
used.
.Sp
If multiple <ntv-select*> tags are used on a form to
control multiple sets of attributes, the selected attributes are
\&\*(L"or-ed\*(R" together;
there is no \*(L"and\*(R" option.
.Sp
If no attributes are selected, a search of the entire text
index is performed.
.Ip "<\fBntv-valueadv\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-valueadv>"
Replaced with \*(L"&adv\*(R" if advanced search mode is active, otherwise deleted.
.Ip "<\fBntv-valuedisplayedhits\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-valuedisplayedhits>"
Replaced with the displayed-hits value issued with the query.  This
represents the number \fIwanted\fR, not necessarily the number being
displayed.

.IX Item "<ntv-valuefuzzyfactor>"
Replaced with the fuzzy-factor value issued with the query.
.Ip "<\fBntv-valuehighlight\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-valuehighlight>"
Replaced with the highlight value issued with the query.
.Ip "<\fBntv-valuetotalhits\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-valuetotalhits>"
Replaced with the totalhits-value issued with the query.  This represents
the number \fIwanted\fR, not necessarily the number found by the query.
.Ip "<\fBntv-vbl *\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-vbl *>"
Replaced by the value of the ntvultralite user-defined variable named as
a parameter.  The name of the variable must start with \*(L"vbl\*(R".
.Ip "<\fBntv-vbleq\fR *<\fB/ntv-vbleq\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-vbleq *</ntv-vbleq>"
The name of a user-defined ntvultralite variable (with the name starting
with \*(L"vbl\*(R") is expected, followed by a textual value.
The \s-1HTML\s0 area between these two tags is substituted if the current value
of the variable matches the value.
Otherwise the area is simply removed.
.Ip "<\fBntv-hit-ifattreq[!] name value\fR>*<\fB/ntv-hit-if\fR>" 4
.IX Item "<ntv-hit-ifattreq[!] name value>*</ntv-hit-if>"
Used inside <ntv-loop>...</ntv-loop>.
If the attribute \fIname\fR has a value equal to \fIvalue\fR the \s-1HTML\s0 area
between the two tags is substituted.  Otherwise it is simply removed.
