INSTALLATION

To install the system in its default location of /usr/local/nextrieve, use
    ./configure
    make depend
    make
    make install

Main configure options and their defaults are:
    --prefix=/usr/local/nextrieve
	Where NexTrieve gets installed.
    --enable-threads=yes
	If threads are to be used in the search daemon, ntvsearchd.

Note that the expat and zlib libraries have their own "./configure" scripts.
If, during make, a Makefile file is not found under either one of these
directories, its configure will be automatically run without arguments
to create one.

If you intend to index PDF documents, you should have pdftotext installed to
perform basic to-text conversion.  Check out http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf if
you don't already have it.  It should be version 1.00 or later, or one that
otherwise understands the '-enc UTF-8' switch.  To test that it's correctly
installed, run the filter manually, eg:
    echo document.pdf | ntvpdffilter

If you intend to index DOC documents, you should have antiword installed to
perform basic to-text conversion.  Check out http://www.winfield.demon.nl if
you don't already have it.  To test that it's correctly installed, run
the filter manually, eg:
    echo document.doc | ntvdocfilter
